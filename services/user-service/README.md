# User Service

## Purpose
User authentication, authorization, and account management service with enterprise-grade security.

## Features (Planned)
- User registration and profile management
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management and security
- Account verification and password reset
- Audit logging for compliance

## Architecture
- **Technology**: TypeScript + Node.js + Express + Passport.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data
- **Cache**: Redis for sessions and rate limiting
- **Security**: bcrypt + JWT + MFA support
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with OpenAPI documentation

## Security Features (Planned)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT with short-lived access tokens + long-lived refresh tokens
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Email verification and password reset flows
- GDPR compliance for data handling

## API Endpoints (Planned)
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update user profile
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset

## Development Status
ðŸš§ **In Development** - Service structure and package.json ready for implementation

## Getting Started
```bash
cd services/user-service
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Next Steps
1. Set up Express server with Passport.js
2. Create user database schema and migrations
3. Implement JWT authentication flow
4. Add MFA support with TOTP
5. Create user management endpoints
