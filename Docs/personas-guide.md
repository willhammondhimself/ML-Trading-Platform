# SuperClaude Personas User Guide 🎭

## 🎭 Personas Auto-Activate - No Need to Choose!

**The simple truth**: You don't need to pick personas or memorize what they do. SuperClaude usually tries to bring in helpful experts for each situation! 

**Here's what actually happens:**
- You type `/analyze auth.js` → Security expert usually jumps in 🛡️
- You work on React components → Frontend specialist often takes over 🎨  
- You debug performance issues → Performance optimizer often helps ⚡
- You write documentation → Professional writer usually helps out ✍️

**It's like having a smart team** that knows when to jump in and help, without you managing who does what. 

**Manual control available** when you want it (like asking specifically for a security review of frontend code), but most of the time you can just... let it work. 🪄

---

## 🚀 Just Try These (No Persona Knowledge Required)

```bash
# These automatically activate the right experts:
/sc:analyze payment-system/         # → Security + backend experts auto-activate
/sc:build react-app/               # → Frontend specialist takes over  
/sc:improve slow-queries.sql       # → Performance optimizer jumps in
/sc:troubleshoot "auth failing"    # → Debug specialist + security expert coordinate
```

**See the pattern?** You focus on what you want to do, SuperClaude figures out who should help. Everything below is for when you get curious about who's on the team.

**How to override**:
```bash
# Explicit persona selection
/sc:analyze frontend-code/ --persona-security  # Security view of frontend
/sc:improve backend-api/ --persona-performance # Performance view of backend

# Multiple persona flags (last one wins)
/sc:analyze --persona-frontend --persona-security # Uses security persona
```

### Persona-Specific Flags and Settings

**Security persona + validation**:
```bash
/sc:analyze --persona-security --focus security --validate
# → Maximum security focus with validation
```

**Performance persona + benchmarking**:
```bash
/sc:test --persona-performance --benchmark --focus performance
# → Performance-focused testing with metrics
```

**Mentor persona + detailed explanations**:
```bash
/sc:explain complex-concept --persona-mentor --verbose
# → Educational explanation with full detail
```

### Cross-Domain Expertise

### Auto-Activation Triggers

**Strong triggers** (usually work well):
- "security audit" → 🛡️ security
- "UI component" → 🎨 frontend  
- "API design" → ⚙️ backend
- "system architecture" → 🏗️ architect
- "debug issue" → 🔍 analyzer

**Moderate triggers** (often work):
- "improve performance" → ⚡ performance
- "write tests" → 🧪 qa
- "clean up code" → 🔄 refactorer
- "deployment issue" → 🚀 devops

**Context-dependent triggers** (varies):
- "document this" → ✍️ scribe or 👨‍🏫 mentor (depends on audience)
- "analyze this" → 🔍 analyzer, 🏗️ architect, or domain specialist (depends on content)

## Troubleshooting Persona Issues 🚨

### Common Problems

**"Wrong persona activated"**
- Use explicit persona flags: `--persona-security`
- Check if your keywords triggered auto-activation
- Try more specific language in your request

**"Persona doesn't seem to work"**
- Verify persona name spelling: `--persona-frontend` not `--persona-fronted`
- Some personas work better with specific commands
- Try combining with relevant flags: `--focus security --persona-security`

**"Want multiple perspectives"**
- Run same command with different personas manually
- Use broader focus flags: `--focus quality` (activates multiple personas)
- Let SuperClaude coordinate automatically with complex requests

**"Persona is too focused"**
- Try a different persona that's more general
- Use mentor persona for broader explanations
- Combine with `--verbose` for more context

### When to Override Auto-Activation

**Override when**:
- Auto-activation chose the wrong specialist
- You want to learn from a different perspective
- Working outside typical domain boundaries
- Need specific expertise for edge cases

**How to override effectively**:
```bash
# Force specific perspective
/sc:analyze frontend-code/ --persona-security  # Security view of frontend

# Combine multiple perspectives
/sc:analyze api/ --persona-security
/sc:analyze api/ --persona-performance  # Run separately for different views

# Use general analysis
/sc:analyze --no-persona  # Disable persona auto-activation
```

## Tips for Effective Persona Usage 💡

### Getting Started (The Honest Way)
1. **Just ignore personas completely at first** - Auto-activation handles everything
2. **Use basic commands normally** - `/analyze`, `/build`, `/improve` work great without persona knowledge
3. **Notice what happens** - You'll see different types of expertise emerge naturally
4. **Trust the automation** - SuperClaude usually picks better experts than manual selection

### Getting Advanced (If You Want To)
1. **Experiment with manual override** - Try `--persona-security` on frontend code for different perspectives
2. **Learn the team members** - Read about individual personas when you get curious
3. **Watch persona combinations** - See how multiple experts collaborate on complex problems
4. **Use for learning** - Ask different personas the same question to see different approaches

### Best Practices (Keep It Simple)
- **Let auto-activation work first** - Override only when you want different perspectives
- **Don't overthink it** - The right experts show up when needed
- **Use for experimentation** - Try different personas on the same problem for learning
- **Trust the intelligence** - Auto-activation learns from patterns and keeps getting better

## Final Notes 📝

**The real truth about personas** 💯:
- **Auto-activation usually works pretty well** compared to trying to pick experts yourself
- **You can completely ignore this guide** and still often get helpful expert assistance
- **Personas exist to help you** - not to create complexity you need to manage
- **Learning happens naturally** through use, not through studying persona descriptions 😊

**Don't feel overwhelmed by the team** 🧘‍♂️:
- You don't need to know what each persona does
- SuperClaude usually handles expert selection reasonably well
- The detailed descriptions above are for curiosity, not necessity
- You're not missing anything by letting auto-activation work

**When you might manually choose personas**:
- **Curiosity** - "What would a security expert think about this frontend code?"
- **Learning** - "How would different experts approach this problem?"
- **Experimentation** - "Let me see this through a performance lens"
- **Override** - "I want architectural advice on this small utility function"

**Keep it simple** 🎯:
- Use normal commands like `/analyze some-code/`
- Let the right experts automatically show up
- Manual persona control is available when you want it, not because you need it
- Focus on your work, not on managing who helps you
