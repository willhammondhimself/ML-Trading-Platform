# SuperClaude Commands Guide üõ†Ô∏è

## üí° Don't Overthink It - SuperClaude Tries to Help

**The truth about these 17 commands**: You don't need to memorize them. Just start with `/sc:analyze` or `/sc:implement` and see what happens! 

**Here's how it usually works:**
- Type `/` in Claude Code ‚Üí See available commands
- Use basic ones like `/sc:analyze`, `/sc:build`, `/sc:improve` 
- **SuperClaude tries to pick helpful tools and experts** for each situation
- More commands become useful as you get comfortable

**Auto-activation is pretty neat** ü™Ñ - SuperClaude attempts to detect what you're trying to do and activate relevant specialists (security expert, performance optimizer, etc.) without you managing it. Usually works well! üòä

## Quick "Just Try These" List üöÄ

**Start here** (no reading required):
```bash
/sc:help                    # See what's available
/sc:analyze src/            # Tries to analyze your code smartly 
/sc:workflow feature-100-prd.md  # Creates step-by-step implementation workflow from PRD
/sc:implement user-auth     # Creates features and components (replaces v2 /build)
/sc:build                   # Attempts intelligent project building
/sc:improve messy-file.js   # Tries to clean up code 
/sc:troubleshoot "error"    # Attempts to help with problems
```

**That's honestly enough to get started.** Everything else below is here when you get curious about what other tools are available. üõ†Ô∏è

## Development Commands üî®

### `/workflow` - Implementation Workflow Generator üó∫Ô∏è
**What it does**: Analyzes PRDs and feature requirements to create comprehensive step-by-step implementation workflows.

**The helpful part**: Takes your PRD and breaks it down into a structured implementation plan with expert guidance, dependency mapping, and task orchestration! üéØ

**When to use it**:
- Starting a new feature from a PRD or specification
- Need a clear implementation roadmap
- Want expert guidance on implementation strategy
- Planning complex features with multiple dependencies

**The magic**: Auto-activates appropriate expert personas (architect, security, frontend, backend) and MCP servers (Context7 for patterns, Sequential for complex analysis) based on your feature requirements.

**Examples**:
```bash
/sc:workflow docs/feature-100-prd.md --strategy systematic --c7 --sequential
/sc:workflow "user authentication system" --persona security --output detailed
/sc:workflow payment-api --strategy mvp --risks --dependencies
```

**What you get**:
- **Roadmap Format**: Phase-based implementation plan with timelines
- **Tasks Format**: Organized epics, stories, and actionable tasks  
- **Detailed Format**: Step-by-step instructions with time estimates
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies
- **Dependency Mapping**: Internal and external dependencies
- **Expert Guidance**: Domain-specific best practices and patterns

### `/implement` - Feature Implementation
**What it does**: Implements features, components, and functionality with intelligent expert activation.

**The helpful part**: SuperClaude auto-activates the right experts (frontend, backend, security) and tools based on what you're implementing! üéØ

**When to use it**:
- Creating new features or components (replaces v2's `/build` functionality)
- Implementing APIs, services, or modules
- Building UI components with modern frameworks
- Developing business logic and integrations

**Basic syntax**:
```bash
/sc:implement user authentication system      # Implement complete feature
/sc:implement --type component LoginForm      # Create specific component  
/sc:implement --type api user-management      # Build API endpoints
/sc:implement --framework react dashboard     # Framework-specific implementation
```

**Useful flags**:
- `--type component|api|service|feature|module` - Implementation type
- `--framework react|vue|express|django|etc` - Target framework
- `--safe` - Conservative implementation approach
- `--iterative` - Step-by-step development with validation
- `--with-tests` - Include test implementation
- `--documentation` - Generate docs alongside code

**Real examples**:
```bash
/sc:implement user authentication --type feature --with-tests
/sc:implement dashboard component --type component --framework react
/sc:implement REST API for orders --type api --safe
/sc:implement payment processing --type service --iterative
/sc:implement search functionality --framework vue --documentation
```

**Auto-activation patterns**:
- **Frontend**: UI components, React/Vue/Angular ‚Üí frontend persona + Magic MCP
- **Backend**: APIs, services, databases ‚Üí backend persona + Context7
- **Security**: Auth, payments, sensitive data ‚Üí security persona + validation
- **Complex features**: Multi-step implementations ‚Üí Sequential MCP + architect persona

**Gotchas**:
- Specify `--type` for better results (component vs service vs feature)
- Use `--framework` when working with specific tech stacks
- Try `--safe` for production code or `--iterative` for complex features
- Remember: this replaces v2's `/build` for actual code implementation

---

### `/build` - Project Building
**What it does**: Builds, compiles, and packages projects with smart error handling.

**The easy way**: Just type `/sc:build` and SuperClaude tries to figure out your build system! üéØ

**When to use it**:
- You need to compile/bundle your project (just try `/sc:build`)
- Build process is failing and you want help debugging  
- Setting up build optimization (it tries to detect what you need)
- Preparing for deployment

**Basic syntax**:
```bash
/sc:build                          # Build current project
/sc:build --type prod              # Production build
/sc:build --clean                  # Clean build (remove old artifacts)
/sc:build --optimize               # Enable optimizations
/sc:build src/                     # Build specific directory
```

/sc:build src/components           # Build just the components folder
```

**Gotchas**:
- Works best with common build tools (npm, webpack, etc.)
- May struggle with very custom build setups
- Check your build tool is in PATH

---

```

### Troubleshooting Command Issues

**Command not working as expected?**
- Try adding `--help` to see all options
- Use `--preview` or `--safe` flags when available
- Start with smaller scope (single file vs. entire project)

**Analysis taking too long?**
- Use `--focus` to narrow scope
- Try `--depth quick` instead of deep analysis
- Analyze smaller directories first

**Build/test commands failing?**
- Make sure your tools are in PATH
- Check that config files are in expected locations
- Try running the underlying commands directly first

**Not sure which command to use?**
- Use `/index` to browse available commands
- Look at the Quick Reference table above
- Try the most specific command first, then broader ones

## Final Notes üìù

**The real truth about these commands** üíØ:
- **Just try them** - You don't need to study this guide first
- **Start with the basics** - `/analyze`, `/build`, `/improve` cover most needs
- **Let auto-activation work** - SuperClaude usually picks helpful experts
- **Experiment freely** - Use `--preview` if you want to see what would happen first

**Still rough around the edges:**
- Complex orchestration (spawn, task) can be a bit flaky
- Some analysis depends heavily on your project setup  
- Error handling could be better in some commands

**Getting better all the time:**
- We actively improve commands based on user feedback
- Newer commands (analyze, improve) tend to work better
- Auto-activation keeps getting smarter

**Don't stress about memorizing this** üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- SuperClaude is designed to be discoverable through use
- Type `/` to see available commands
- Commands suggest what they can do when you use `--help`
- The intelligent routing handles most of the complexity

**Need help?** Check the GitHub issues or create a new one if you're stuck! üöÄ
