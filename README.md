## About Me

I'm a second-year student at Pitzer College, double-majoring in Physics and Applied Mathematics. I'm passionate about blending my academic foundation in math and physics with software engineering, especially in quantitative finance. As a student, I'm still building my skills, but I love tackling real-world projects to learn through hands-on experience.

## What I'm Working On

### [CruxAI ‚Äì Computer Vision Training Assistant](https://github.com/willhammondhimself/cruxai)
My flagship project as a solo founder and developer: A cross-platform app using computer vision to assist with training and performance tracking. Built to apply my physics knowledge (like motion analysis) in a practical AI tool, this has been an incredible learning experience in end-to-end ML development.

- Created an ML pipeline from scratch: Annotated 3,500+ data points to train a YOLOv8 model, achieving 80%+ accuracy through systematic optimization and validation
- Developed real-time video processing with 35ms inference time on mobile devices, using lightweight models under 50MB and 90%+ test coverage
- Built a full cross-platform app (iOS, Android, Web) with React Native and Supabase backend, featuring offline-first design, A/B testing, and metrics tracking
- Focused on performance-driven iteration: Automated model validation, data-driven cycles, and real-world testing to refine accuracy and speed

This project bridges my academic interests in physics with AI, helping users analyze movements in sports like climbing‚Äîit's taught me tons about production deployment and iterative improvement.

### [Quantum Edge ‚Äì Quantum-Inspired Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/willhammondhimself/quantum-edge)
Applying quantum computing concepts from my physics studies to finance: A tool for advanced portfolio management that outperforms traditional methods in tough scenarios.

- Implemented quantum annealing algorithms on classical hardware, achieving 43% better worst-case performance than mean-variance optimization during market crises
- Built a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for eigen portfolio discovery, with custom ADMM solvers and adversarial GAN testing
- Developed a real-time rebalancing system with sub-100 microsecond latency using Rust, showing 28% lower maximum drawdown in 2008/2020 backtests

This lets me experiment with quantum principles in practical quant finance while sharpening my skills in high-performance computing.

### [Systematic Trading Platform ‚Äì Real-Time Alpha Generation Engine](https://github.com/willhammondhimself/ml-trading-platform)
A full-stack trading system processing live market data‚Äîbuilt to explore how math and physics models can predict financial patterns.

- Architected for high-frequency capabilities: Handles 1,000+ market updates per second with sub-100ms latency using Python, React, PostgreSQL, and WebSockets
- Features ensemble ML models (LSTM, Transformer, Random Forest) with 73% directional accuracy in 2-year S&P 500 backtests
- Includes a Monte Carlo risk engine running 100,000+ scenarios for real-time VaR and optimization, outperforming benchmarks by 15%
- Integrates alternative data like news sentiment with statistical testing for enhanced predictions

This project combines my coursework in statistics and computational physics with real-world trading tech.

## Learning Journey

Currently diving into:
- üßÆ Math [Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Discrete Math]
- ‚öõÔ∏è Physics [Modern, Quantum, Statistical Mechanics]
- ML techniques for finance, including LSTMs and transformers
- Low-latency systems with Rust and real-time data streaming

Recent wins:
